  <h2>My Advent of Code 2025 Solutions</h2>
  <p>
    My solutions for Advent of Code 2025, showcasing a modern
    <a href="https://angular.dev" rel="noreferrer">Angular frontend </a> with a
    <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org" rel="noreferrer">Rust</a> solver compiled to
    <a href="https://webassembly.org" rel="noreferrer">WebAssembly</a>. This allows for
    high-performance code execution while leveraging Angular for a rich user interface. All
    computations are offloaded to a background Web Worker to ensure the UI remains responsive. You
    can find the source code on
    <a href="https://github.com/meisterlala/advent-of-code-2025" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Deployed to both
    <a href="https://meisterlala.github.io/advent-of-code-2025/" rel="noreferrer">GitHub Pages</a>
    and my self-managed
    <a href="https://adventofcode2025.meisterlala.dev/" rel="noreferrer">Kubernetes cluster</a>. You
    can also run the rust project locally without the Angular Frontent. See the
    <a href="https://github.com/meisterlala/advent-of-code-2025#readme" rel="noreferrer">README</a>
    in the repository for instructions. Tests and benchmarks are included to ensure correctness and
    measure performance of the solutions.
