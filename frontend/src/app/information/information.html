    My solutions for Advent of Code 2025, showcasing a modern Angular frontend with a Rust-based
    solver compiled to WebAssembly. You can find the source code on
    <a href="https://github.com/meisterlala/advent-of-code-2025" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Deployed to both GitHub Pages and my self-managed
    <a href="https://adventofcode2025.meisterlala.dev/" rel="noreferrer">Kubernetes cluster</a>. You
    can also run the rust project locally without the Angular Frontent. See the
    <a href="https://github.com/meisterlala/advent-of-code-2025#readme" rel="noreferrer">README</a>
    in the repository for instructions.
